# Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection Report

## 1. Introduction
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing
sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This task demonstrates a simulated
phishing attack for educational and awareness purposes only.

## 2. Objective
The objective of this task is to understand how phishing attacks work, identify phishing red
flags, and learn effective prevention techniques.

## 3. Phishing Email Template
A fake phishing email was created using urgent language and a suspicious link to simulate a
real-world phishing attack. The email encourages the user to verify their account immediately.

## 4. Fake Login Landing Page
A fake login page was designed using HTML to simulate how attackers collect credentials.
No real credentials were collected during this simulation.

## 5. Phishing Simulation
The phishing email was tested in a controlled environment using self-testing.
The phishing link was clicked once to demonstrate victim interaction.

## 6. Response Tracking
Email Sent: 1 (Self-test)  
Link Clicked: 1  
Credentials Submitted: 0  

## 7. Phishing Red Flags Identified
- Use of urgent and threatening language
- Generic greeting instead of user name
- Suspicious and untrusted link
- Request for login credentials
- No official branding or verification

## 8. Phishing Prevention Methods
- Do not click unknown or suspicious links
- Always verify the sender’s email address
- Never share login credentials on unknown websites
- Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Enable email spam filters
- Provide user awareness and security training

## 9. Conclusion
This phishing simulation task helped in understanding how phishing attacks are performed and
how users can identify and prevent them. The activity increased awareness about social
engineering attacks and cybersecurity best practices.
